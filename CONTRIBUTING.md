I have done bugfixing for the correction of response size of DID 0140
As per the requirement the response size is 20 bytes and the root cause is it is not correctly configured 
after proper configuration has been done for the DID 0140 data length as 160 (bits), getting the response size as expected.
i am attaching the screenshot for your reference

one more bugfix i want to add
for DTC message Time out the parameter called debounce algorithm should be correctly configured 
the counter value = the requirement time/cycle time of message
